#' Harmonic Mean
#' 
#' Functions to calculate the harmonic mean and weighted harmonic mean of a set
#' of data.
#' 
#' @name hmean
#' 
#' @param x A numeric vector containing a set of observations.
#' @param w A numeric vector containing the observation weights.
#' 
#' @return A numeric value.
#' 
#' @details The (weighted) harmonic mean of a data set is the inverse of the
#' (weighted) mean of the inverse values. As such, any 0 value in the data (or
#' in the non-zero weighted data in the weighted case) will result in the
#' functions returning a value of 0. It is worth recall that whereas the value
#' of the arithmetic mean is strongly influenced by even a few extreme values,
#' the value of the harmonic mean is strongly influenced by even a few small
#' values. The function take any numeric values. However, the harmonic mean of
#' data containing both positive and negative values is unlikely to be stable.

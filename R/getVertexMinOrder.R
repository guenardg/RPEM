## Get the mininum order of a vertex with respect to the origin(s). Though
## multiple may be present, such a situation may involve problems and the
## default behavior is to warn whenever multiple origins are present in order
## to help in solving programming issues. Setting warnMultipleOrigins to FALSE
## will turn off multiple origin warning.
## This is an internal function; it as no formal R documentation.
